## 🧱 Using the Template

1. Copy `template.html` to a new file (e.g., `healthcare/index.html`)
2. Update the hero title and stat badges
3. Add/rename tabs in the nav bar
4. Add chart data to `initCharts()` switch cases
5. Commit and push — GitHub Pages handles the rest

The template includes pre-solved bugs:
- ✅ Tab system that actually works (no `event.target` issues)
- ✅ Lazy chart initialization (prevents "exceeded max connections")
- ✅ Chart cleanup on tab switch (no memory leaks)
- ✅ Responsive grid (mobile → tablet → desktop)
- ✅ Utility functions (`nF()`, `dF()`, `pF()`, `safeChart()`)

## 📋 Master Data Reference

[MASTER_DATA.md](MASTER_DATA.md) is the single source of truth for all figures used across dashboards. Every entry includes the figure, source, source URL, and verification date.

When starting a new Claude chat, say:
> "See MASTER_DATA.md in my Massachusetts-Data-Hub repo for all verified figures."

## 🚀 Deployment

This site is hosted via GitHub Pages:
1. Settings → Pages → Deploy from branch: **main** / **root**

## 📄 Migration from Old Repos

Dashboards are being migrated from these repos:
- `duncanburns2013-dot/Immigration`
- `duncanburns2013-dot/Housing-Market-Data`
